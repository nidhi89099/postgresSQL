PRIMARY KEY										FOREIGN KEY
A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique.	A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database 										table that provides a link between data in two tables.
It uniquely identifies a record in the relational database table.	It refers to the field in a table which is the primary key of another 										table.
Only one primary key is allowed in a table.				Whereas more than one foreign key is allowed in a table.
It is a combination of UNIQUE and Not Null constraints.			It can contain duplicate values and a table in a relational database.It does not allow NULL values.						It can also contain NULL values.
Its value cannot be deleted from the parent table.			Its value can be deleted from the child table.
It constraint can be implicitly defined on the temporary tables.	It constraint cannot be defined on the local or global temporary tables.
